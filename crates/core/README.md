# pourpoint-core

Pure-Rust core library for the pourpoint watershed extraction engine. It handles two responsibilities: loading HFX datasets from disk (`session` + `reader`), and providing all watershed-delineation algorithms (`algo`). External capabilities — GDAL raster I/O, GEOS geometry repair — are kept behind traits defined here and implemented in `pourpoint-gdal`, so the hot path has no native dependencies.

## Snap Strategy

`ResolverConfig::new()` defaults to `SnapStrategy::WeightFirst` to align with the HFX v0.2 weight contract, which requires that the `weight` column be monotonically increasing in drainage dominance (higher weight = more hydrologically significant reach). Under this default, when an outlet is coincident with a tiny tributary stub, the hydrologically dominant mainstem candidate wins over the geometrically closest one. `SnapStrategy::DistanceFirst` remains available for datasets whose `weight` column is not rank-meaningful: configure it via `ResolverConfig::new().with_snap_strategy(SnapStrategy::DistanceFirst)`.

## Staged Delineation Contract

Staged delineation is implemented around typed intermediate outputs while the
stable `Engine::delineate` surface remains the public one-call API.

Public delineation results are unit-named at the Rust API boundary:
`terminal_unit_id()`, `upstream_unit_ids()`, `resolved_outlet()`,
`resolution_method()`, and `geometry_wkb()` are the stable accessors consumed by
downstream export work.

```

`PreMergeDrainageUnit` is an inspection record for pristine upstream drainage
units. The collection includes the whole terminal polygon before any terminal
refinement. This distinction is intentional: pre-merge drainage-unit records
are pristine inspection records and do not define final watershed output after
refinement. Summing pre-merge `area` values does not define final `area_km2`,
and unioning pre-merge geometries does not define final refined geometry. Final
geometry and area are produced only by the downstream dissolve/assemble stage.
Export persistence, including future GeoParquet output, must consume the
composed final result instead of treating pre-merge records as the final basin.

The Rust terminal-refinement strategy seam is exposed with a deliberately
D8-specific context: the strategy receives the `DatasetSession` plus the
engine-attached `RasterSource` needed by the built-in D8 path. Full custom
auxiliary binding and general auxiliary-to-strategy dispatch are outside the
current runtime surface.

## Terminal Refinement Scope

The engine currently ships exactly one built-in terminal-refinement strategy:
D8 raster refinement. The current strategy context is intentionally D8-only.
Full auxiliary schema-to-strategy binding, reverse-DNS auxiliary parsing,
Python-authored strategies, and additional built-in strategies are outside the
current runtime surface.

The built-in D8 carve sequence is fixed as:

```text
rasterize terminal -> mask flow-dir + accumulation -> snap -> masked trace -> polygonize
```

Inside this carve stack, `GeoTransform`, rasterization, snapping, tracing,
polygonization, `SnappedPoint`, and `RefinementResult` use raster-native x/y
coordinates. The complete data flow is:

```text
EPSG:4326 terminal -> per-declaration forward projection -> native coverage and localization
-> native raster carve and snap -> inverse carved rings and outlet only -> EPSG:4326 result
```

D8 grids are never warped, resampled, or reprojected. Supported declaration
CRSs are exactly the existing `Crs` variants. An unsupported declaration CRS is
a D8 selection error. The selected carved rings and snapped outlet are the only
values inverse-transformed, and component, ring, and vertex order is retained.
The EPSG:4326 identity path remains byte-exact because its forward and inverse
operations only move coordinate fields.

For `cells`, snapping preserves `threshold.as_f32()` behavior. For `km2`, the
effective threshold is evaluated as
`threshold_cells as f64 * (pixel_width * pixel_height).abs() / 1_000_000.0`;
the completed result is cast exactly once to `f32` and compared directly with
the raw `f32` accumulation sample. EPSG:4326 plus `km2` is a refinement error
because geographic pixel area is not approximated.

`forward` remains instrumented, so selection produces one existing-default-level
span per ring vertex per candidate declaration. Unsupported CRS failures travel
through `EngineError::D8Selection` and map to Python `DatasetError`.
Geographic-`km2` and inverse failures travel through `EngineError::Refinement`
and map to generic Python `PourpointError`; this classification difference
preserves the existing `EngineError` variants.

There is no vector clamp, intersection, or cleaning pass in the refinement
algorithm. Final watershed assembly is always merge-after: preserve pristine
pre-merge unit records for inspection, exclude the whole terminal from final
assembly, insert the refined terminal geometry, and then dissolve/assemble. This
is why pristine pre-merge terminal geometry and area can differ from the final
refined geometry and `area_km2`.

D8 tile coverage uses inclusive rectangle semantics, so exact bbox equality and
edge-touching count. This is a rectangular-extent selection policy. When more
than one declaration fully covers the terminal bbox — the expected case for a
per-Pfaf-02 partitioned D8 fabric, where irregular basins have overlapping
rectangular extents — selection collapses to the manifest-first covering
declaration and logs the discarded candidates at `warn`. This is sound because
`hfx.aux.d8_raster.v2` requires overlapping entries to be windows of a single
coherent D8 fabric (byte-identical values in the overlap), and the carve never
reads outside the terminal bbox, so any covering tile yields the same carve.
Real MERIT-Hydro `merit/0.2.0` for `rhine_basel` therefore carves successfully.
[`SessionError::AmbiguousD8Coverage`] is retained for callers that need the
un-collapsed candidate set or for fabrics whose overlap-agreement is not
guaranteed. `TerminalSpansD8Tiles` (bbox straddles a boundary, no single tile
fully covers it) and `NoCoveringD8Tile` still hard-error.

Every `hfx.aux.d8_raster.v2` declaration requires typed `crs`,
`flow_dir_encoding`, and `flow_acc_units` metadata. Flow direction accepts
`uint8` or `int8`; accumulation accepts `float32` or `int32`, with `cells`
requiring `float32`. Signed values normalize at the reader boundary to the
engine's existing `RasterTile<u8>` and `RasterTile<f32>` representations.

Regression gates for the D8 strategy seam and synthetic parity goldens:

```bash
cargo build --workspace --exclude pourpoint-python
cargo check -p pourpoint-python
cargo test -p pourpoint-core --test d8_refinement_parity
cargo test -p pourpoint-core --test d8_aux_accessor
cargo test -p pourpoint-core --test parity_golden_artifacts
cargo test -p pourpoint-core --test staged_delineation
```

Network-gated boundary proof:

```bash
POURPOINT_HFX_V02_REAL_D8_REFINEMENT=1 cargo test -p pourpoint-core --test d8_refinement_parity -- --ignored --nocapture
```

These gates do not verify successful real-data carving on overlapping-Pfaf
terminals; they verify that the offline D8 path works and that the typed
ambiguity boundary is surfaced for real MERIT coverage conflicts.
